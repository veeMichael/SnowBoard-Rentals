C# Windows Forms Project

This project was created as part of a C# class homework assignment. It is a simple cost calculator for snowboard rentals that demonstrates the use of Windows Forms, variables, event handlers and functions.

The project takes input from the user on the number of snowboards rented with or without boots, calculates the total cost and displays the results. The program also keeps track of the total revenue generated by all orders and the average revenue per order.

The project was built using Microsoft Visual Studio and uses the .NET framework. The code is written in C# and follows good coding practices and techniques.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the program.
